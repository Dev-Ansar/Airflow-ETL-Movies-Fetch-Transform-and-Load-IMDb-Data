# Airflow ETL: Fetch, Transform, and Load IMDb Data

This project demonstrates how to build a robust ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow. The pipeline extracts IMDb's top movie data from an API, transforms the data for analysis, and loads it into a PostgreSQL relational database. The entire application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
